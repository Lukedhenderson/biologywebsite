            <h2>What is Blue Light?</h2>
            <p>“Blue light” refers to visible light in the 380-495 nm wavelength range (Hipólito). Blue light is naturally emitted from the sun and makes up many of the colors you see every day. Light of this wavelength is what makes the sky appear blue. Blue light is also produced by modern LED device screens. When blue light hits your eyes during the day, it has many benefits. Blue light boosts alertness, mood, and plays a key role in regulating the circadian clock (the natural sleep-wake cycle in humans) (Harvard).</p>          </div>

            <h2>Vision Damage Myth</h2>
            <p>Despite the widespread panic about blue light’s effect on vision, the scientific evidence suggests that fears about permanent eye damage are over exaggerated. Scientific studies finding significant damage of retinal cells like the one cited in The Guardian are not reflective of real life. These studies were conducted in vitro by exposing test tube organisms to unnaturally high levels of blue light. Everyday use of digital devices has no effect on degrading vision or other eye related diseases.</p>          </div>

            <h2>Eye Strain Myth</h2>
            <p>Although blue light has not been found to cause long term vision loss or other eye disease, another claim is that it contributes to digital eye strain. Around 77% of adults experience digital eye strain from hours of screen time at work and home (WatLens). However, research indicates that blue light filtering glasses have not been proven to prevent eye strain (Cougnard-Gregoire). Eye strain is mainly caused by extended near focusing and not blinking enough while on screens.</p>          </div>

        <section id="sleep-effects" class="content-section">
          <div class="section-text">
            <h2>Effects on Sleep</h2>
            <p>Although blue light has been falsely accused of causing vision damage, its effects on sleep are unmistakable. Blue light strongly influences our internal circadian rhythm by suppressing melatonin and signaling the brain to stay awake. Studies at Harvard found that blue light shifts circadian rhythms twice as much as other wavelengths of light (Harvard). Sleep deprivation caused by disrupted circadian rhythms has well documented consequences on mood, cognitive ability, and risk for other disorders (Hale).</p>          </div>

        <section id="research-gaps" class="content-section alt">
          <div class="section-text">
            <h2>Research Gaps</h2>
            <p>Although there has been significant progress in research about blue light's effects, there are still gaps in knowledge. Researchers are uncertain if extended periods of screen time will contribute to early onset vision problems (Cougnard-Gregoire). Current mitigation strategies like blue light filtering glasses and orange-tinted display modes like Apple’s “Night Mode” yield inconclusive results about improving sleep quality.</p>          </div>

        <!-- Conclusions -->
        <section id="conclusions" class="content-section">
          <div class="section-text full-width">
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Overall, the media panic over blue light exposure is not supported by scientific evidence. There is no evidence that blue light damages vision or increases risk for degenerative eye diseases. However, blue light significantly impacts sleep quality, and limiting screen time around bedtime is recommended.</p>
